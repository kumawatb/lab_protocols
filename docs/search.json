Incubate at 37C and start checking for cells after 40 minutes.\n\nMake an additional such dilution to visually check for phage clearing later. No P1 phage will be added to this control culture.\nStart a 42C water bath for incubation after addition of P1 phage.\n\n\nDay 1\n\nAfter around 45-60 minutes, if the culture has swirls when held up the light and shaken, add 50uL of the high-titer P1 phage stock to the culture.

(eg. Kan for keio collection donors).\n\n\nDay 1 or 2\n\nAfter 1 hour, spin down the cells, discard the supernatant, and resuspend in 100uL LB media. Spread, the cells on LB plates containing 5mM Sodium Citrate and antibiotic. Incubate the plates at 37C\n\nDay 2 or 3\n\nCheck the plates the next day, no-phage plates should have no colonies.

(I usually divide a plate into 8 sectors).\nFor 10uL reactions and N colonies, create a batch PCR mix that is 10 times (N+1) uL in volume.

Divide the batch mix into individual PCR tubes, with 10ul volume per tube. Label one of them the negative control (-) and the rest as C1 to CN, where N is the number of colonies you wish to PCR.\nNow, number N colonies on your plate of interest with a marker (from 1 to N). Number the subdivisions on the new plate the same way.\nFor each colony, pick it using a sterile pipette tip from the plate of interest and streak it in the correct section on the new plate. Then dip the same pipette tip into the prepared PCR reaction tube with the correct colony number. The negative control tube (-) gets no colonies.\nPerform the PCR reactions with the appropriate settings for the polymerase and run the samples on a 1% Agarose gel for checking the results.",
